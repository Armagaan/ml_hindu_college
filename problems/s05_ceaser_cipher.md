# Caeser Cipher

Caesar cipher is a simple encryption technique that was developed by Julius Caesar. It is a type of substitution cipher, where each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter that is a fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For example, if the shift is 3, then A would be replaced by D, b would be replaced by e, and so on.

To encrypt a message using a Caesar cipher, you first need to choose a shift value. Once you have chosen a shift value, you then need to replace each letter in the plaintext with the letter that is that many positions down the alphabet.

For example, if the shift value is 3, then the plaintext message "hello" would be encrypted as "khoor"; "zoo" would be encrypted as "crr".

To decrypt a message that has been encrypted using a Caesar cipher, you simply need to reverse the encryption process. In other words, you replace each letter in the ciphertext with the letter that is that many positions up the alphabet.

For example, the ciphertext message "khoor" would be decrypted as "hello" if the shift value was 3.
